## Favorite Existing Apps - Categorize and Evaluate
### Bank of America
   - **Category:** Finance 
   - **Mobile:** Simplified website, all the functionalities you would need to bank through your phone. Can deposit checks by taking a picture with camera.
   - **Story:** Allows users to more easily bank with BoA with core and additional functionalities.
   - **Market:** Anyone who banks with BoA.
   - **Habit:** Depends on user type - those who bank frequently would highly appreciate the ease of banking through an app. Even the average user would appreciate not having to log onto a computer to bank.
   - **Scope:** It offers many features of core banking as well as additional ones - I am sure it took quite a while to test and roll out a secure banking app with so many functionalities.

### Pandora
   - **Category:** Music 
   - **Mobile:** Simplified website, has all the functionalities you would need to use Pandora on your phone. 
   - **Story:** Allows users to use Pandora from their phone on the go.
   - **Market:** Existing Pandora users, as well as anyone who consumes music.
   - **Habit:** Music is always consumed, thus so is Pandora. The average user may use it as much or more than they use Pandora.com.
   - **Scope:** It has to mimic website funcitonalities - as long as they can use the same APIs to access the same features, making the app was most likely straightforward for Pandora.

### Lyft
   - **Category:** Travel, Lifestyle 
   - **Mobile:** Solely mobile experience. 
   - **Story:** Allows users to get from point A to point B using only their smartphone.
   - **Market:** Potential customers is always growing based on supply and company growth. Everyone needs to get from point A to point B.
   - **Habit:** Can get addicting if you rely on it and don't have a car.
   - **Scope:** The current algorithms behind it are difficult to create without time and testing. It has potential to change how humans move especially through its autonomous vehicle pursuits.

### Venmo
   - **Category:** Finance 
   - **Mobile:** Solely mobile experience. 
   - **Story:** Allows users to pay friends/other users using only their smartphone from their bank accounts or Venmo money.
   - **Market:** Potential customers is always growing since paying friends is always going to happen. The more customers use it, the more others trust it, and the more new customers are attracted.
   - **Habit:** Can develop a habit to pay through venmo, although not everyone accepts Venmo. However, there is a Venmo card (non-mobile) that can be accepted anywhere MasterCard is accepted.
   - **Scope:** It could potentially takeover social banking, especially if faster than banks. The current app is seemingly simple yet financially complex and requires many resources to get the developed functionality that it has today.

### Reminders
   - **Category:** Productivity 
   - **Mobile:** Apple mobile and Mac experience.
   - **Story:** Allows users to create reminders, alerts, and todo lists.
   - **Market:** Apple consumers.
   - **Habit:** Can become a habit since you can create reminders verbally through Siri.
   - **Scope:** Not much scope besides Apple users. Could integrate more functionalities.

## New App Ideas - List
1. Uber for grad/prom photographers
   - Allows students to hire amateur photographers for milestone events. Currently finding photographers for these events is done through friends or word of mouth. Additionally, many millenials own DSLRs or other professional cameras that are sitting at home, and used occasionally at events or to learn. By having a central place to access photographers and photographees, we can connect both groups and everyone would benefit from a streamlined photography process. 
1. Board game night finder
    - App to host and find game nights put on by friends or strangers, in safe public places.
3. Teach, learn, and make music
    - App to connect those who wish to learn music or an instrument with those who know it. Can also be used to find people to jam with.
5. Meet up with people to talk about life
    - App to meet random people who similarly wish to talk about life and listen to anyone's thoughts. Idea modeled off of ThoughtLounge, a club at my school with branches elsewhere as well.
7. Tiffin service
    - App to get homemade Indian food delivered

1. Uber for grad/prom photographers
   - **Description**: Allows students to hire amateur photographers for milestone events. Currently finding photographers for these events is done through friends or word of mouth. Additionally, many millenials own DSLRs or other professional cameras that are sitting at home, and used occasionally at events or to learn. By having a central place to access photographers and photographees, we can connect both groups and everyone would benefit from a streamlined photography process. 
   - **Category:** Photography
   - **Mobile:** Mobile provides instant notifications of matches for photographers and customers, so as to save time. It can connect to photographer's instagram, etc. to link to other apps. It can also make use of a user's location to optimize matches.
   - **Story:** Creates a streamlined platform for students to hire grad/prom photographers easily. Provides a place for amateur photographers to practice, make some money, and make use of their dusty cameras.
   - **Market:** Niche market of students who need grad/prom photos and amateur photographers (most likely other students). 
   - **Habit:** Would be used for these milestone events by users and their friends. Can optionally add ease of pay (Venmo) and content creation for photographers (browse their portfolio).
   - **Scope:** Must provide platform to sign up as photographer and customer. Having a portfolio for every photographer would be a great feature, along with booking, payment, and schedule details. Users can browse and select photographers that are close, available when needed, and whose portfolios they like. This can be simplified to just offer a few photographers at UCLA and no search functionality, just browsing the master list of photographers.
