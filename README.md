### App Description
Allows students to hire amateur photographers for milestone events. Currently finding photographers for these events is done through friends or word of mouth. Additionally, many millenials own DSLRs or other professional cameras that are sitting at home, and used occasionally at events or to learn. By having a central place to access photographers and photographees, we can connect both groups and everyone would benefit from a streamlined photography process.

### App Idea Evaluation
- Mobile: Mobile provides instant notifications of matches for photographers and customers, so as to save time. It can connect to photographer's instagram, etc. to link to other apps. It can also make use of a user's location to optimize matches.
- Story: Creates a streamlined platform for students to hire grad/prom photographers easily. Provides a place for amateur photographers to practice, make some money, and make use of their dusty cameras.
- Market: Niche market of students who need grad/prom photos and amateur photographers (most likely other students).
- Habit: Would be used for these milestone events by users and their friends. Can optionally add ease of pay (Venmo) and content creation for photographers (browse their portfolio).
- Scope: Must provide platform to sign up as photographer and customer. Having a portfolio for every photographer would be a great feature, along with booking, payment, and schedule details. Users can browse and select photographers that are close, available when needed, and whose portfolios they like. This can be simplified to just offer a few photographers at UCLA and no search functionality, just browsing the master list of photographers.
